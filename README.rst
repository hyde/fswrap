Version 0.1.0

Unified object oriented interface for interacting with file system objects.
File system operations in python are distributed across modules: os, os.path,
fnamtch, shutil and distutils. This module attempts to make the right choices
for common operations to provide a single interface.

This was extracted from the `hyde project`_ with minor changes.
