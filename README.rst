Version 1.0.0

Unified object oriented interface for interacting with file system
objects. File system operations in python are distributed across
modules: os, os.path, fnmatch, shutil and distutils. This module
attempts to make the right choices for common operations to provide a
single interface.

This was extracted from the `hyde project`_ with minor changes.
